Sirve – WordPress Listing Plugin 

Sirve is a handy WordPress listing plugin that allows you to create your own service listing in a professional way on your website. It can come in real handy in terms of creating listings of services or products and is well-suited for service providers, products, or any other type of product/service that needs to be marketed and sold. It's convenient and easy to use!

With Sirve, it only takes just a while to set up an eye-catching service or product listings page through the tons of intuitive and user-friendly features it provides. Here you will get 4 archive page styles. This listing plugin for WordPress has a pagination option and AJAX features to make your site's navigation easier. You can choose whether or not you want the post detail/page details to appear, simply by enabling or disabling Post detail Page /detail options. The shortcode can be inserted in the post editor as well, so that's another option for you.

With the Sirve listing WordPress plugin, you can make your posts sticky. This is useful for when you want a particular post to feature first, giving it more visibility since putting one specific piece of post on top of others gives it extra exposure. 

On top of that, Sirve provides you with an intuitive settings panel. Therefore you can manage a lot of things such as selecting the number of words you want to show in the grid, the number of lists on a page, etc. Besides, you can choose whether to show your list in ascending or descending order and also choose whether your post order is to be shown based on various attributes like ID, title, date, random order, etc. 

Sirve contains two buttons and it gives you complete control over the look and feel of your listing pages, allowing you to change the text color, hover color, background color, background header color, border color, and other aspects of the buttons.

So, in a word, if you're looking for a simple yet user-friendly plugin that will adorn your listing page, look no further than this great option.
